		from C:\Users\User\Documents\RS232 FTP\CR.RS232FileTransfer\Randtech.RS232FileTransfer\data\
	7) Created the Get.bat, Send.bat, and Receive.bat files so that steps 3.1 and 3.2 work, 
		in C:\Users\User\ (default folder opened when performing step 3.1a
	8) Tested that a file was uploaded using source file C:\data\datafile.txt; and was saved 
		as C:\data\test results\incoming.txt (needs filename fixing as should use name from config file). 
		Exception thrown. Had to debug.

5 - Technical Dev Notes
-----------------------
Main files to consider are the 2 executables Upload.exe and Download.exe in the source. The are ran using the 
batch files Send.bat and Receive.bat by opening two command prompts, and after navigating to the relevant folder, 
you run the executables via these batch files by typing in one "receive" and in the other "send"
