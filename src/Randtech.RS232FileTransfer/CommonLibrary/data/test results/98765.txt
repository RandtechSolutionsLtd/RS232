this is the file that will be created on the RECEIVE computer.
the file should respect CR's so that the file format is preserved.
note that the file name is the same as the first 5 numbers... no test is rquired just grab the first 5 characters
once the file has been crated correctly on the RECEIVE computer a handshake back to the SEND computer should be made before the SEND program terminates
A suitable handshake might be checking that the number of chr$ in each file match.
this program should only be a light load on the CPU
this program has no HMI
there should be a file in C:\data\FileTransfer\... called FileTransferReceive.txt which will contain the following:

C:\data\test results
com 4

This tells the program what com port to use and what dir to save to.
The .exe will reside in C:\data\FileTransfer\
